# DBDP-GUI
An interactive GUI that allows users of any skill level to develop biomarkers off wearables data

## General Information
Developing biomarkers is hard - not only is it required that you have sufficient clinical background to understand the biomarker itself, but you also need the technical chops to be able to analyze data and develop appropriate statistical models. The Digital Biomarker Discovery Pipeline (DBDP) GUI attempts to remedy this by providing an interactive GUI that allows a user of any background to develop digital biomarkers with their own wearables data. 

The functions provided are sourced directly from the DBDP - https://github.com/DigitalBiomarkerDiscoveryPipeline/DBDP.
